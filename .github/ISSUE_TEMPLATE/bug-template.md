### Bug report

To write a bug report, we have defined a small, helpful workflow, to keep communication effective.

- pyDataverse version (e. g. 0.2.1)
- Python version (e. g. 3.6.9)
- Dataverse version (if used) (e. g. 4.18.1)

**2. Actual behavior:** 

[What actually happened]

3. [and so on...]

**5. Possible solution**

[If you have a clue, tell what could be the actual solution for the problem]

**6. Check your bug report**

Before you submit the issue

* Check if all information necessary to understand the problem is in.
* Check if your language is written in a positive way.

**What happens after the issue creation?**

After you submitted the issue, the following steps will be coordinated by the Issue Manager (skasberger):

* Decide, if the issue is valid or not.
* Decide further actions, label the issue properly and assign the issue to someone.
* Fix the issue (by assigned person).
* Test and review the actions.
* Close the issue
